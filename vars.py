# Write a Python program to add two numbers.

# Write a Python program to find the remainder when a number is divided by Z(Integer).

# Check the type of the variable assigned using the input() function.
print(type(input("Enter anything: ")))

# Use a comparison operator to find out whether a given variable a is greater than b or not. (Take a=34 and b=80)
print("Is c>Z: ", (c > Z))

# Write a Python program to find the average of two numbers entered by the user.
